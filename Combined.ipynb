      "            \"content\": \"\\n\\n\\\"She's Out of Her Mind\\\" is a song recorded by American rock band Blink-182 for the group's seventh studio album, California (2016). The song was released as the second single from California on October 11, 2016 through BMG. Originally titled \\\"Orange County Girl\\\", the song was re-written multiple times to make its chorus as catchy as possible. It contains lyrical references to the bands the Cure and Bauhaus. Its music video stars social media personalities running the streets of Los Angeles in the nude\\u2014a remake of the video for the band's 1999 song \\\"What's My Age Again?\\\".\\n\\nThe song has thus far peaked at number 27 on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nProduer John Feldmann first came up with the lyrical concept for the song while walking around Disneyland with his children. He created the song's early working title, \\\"Orange County Girl\\\" \\u2014 as Hoppus's wife, Skye Everly, is from Orange County, California, and Blink are a Southern California-based group. The song came together early in the recording process. According to producer John Feldmann, \\\"We wanted to write a classic, no-brainer pop-punk song: major key, fun, happy, classic.\\\" The chorus was the result of multiple rewrites, with each draft attempting to perfect the chorus preceding it. \\\"The end result is the combination of maybe four or five different choruses,\\\" Hoppus said. He considered it the song that was worked on the hardest while creating the album California, and a \\\"deceptively simple song.\\\"\\n\\nBarker's daughter, Alabama Barker, performs piano on the song. \\\"We were still figuring out parts, and Alabama walks over to the piano and says, 'I have an idea,' and she starts playing this idea that ended up becoming the bridge part of the piano; it was very organic,\\\" Barker told People. \\\"I was so proud of her.\\\" As the rest of the album developed, the song was nearly shelved and left off the album because it seemed overly happy compared to the rest of the songs. In the end, Barker was responsible for keeping it on the album, noting to Feldmann, \\\"Dude, we cannot leave this song off the record. It's too important for the Take Off Your Pants and Jacket-era of Blink.\\\"\\n\\nThe song also references the post-punk band Bauhaus in its chorus, and also alludes to the Cure's album The Head on the Door (1985). Skiba developed the Bauhaus lyric, and though the team briefly worried Blink fans would be unfamiliar with the reference, they decided to include it anyway. The song was first announced as a single on August 1, 2016 through Mushroom Promotions, the marketing arm of Liberator Music, who handled distribution for California in Australia. An article in The Sun several days later confirmed the song to be the follow-up single to \\\"Bored to Death\\\".\\n\\nCommercial performance\\n\\n\\\"She's Out of Her Mind\\\" first charted at number 18 on Billboard's Hot Rock Songs chart based on high downloads the week California was released, before its debut as an official single. It was serviced to alternative radio in the U.S. beginning on October 11, 2016. That week, it debuted at number 35 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. It has thus far peaked at number 27.\\n\\nCritical reception\\n\\nChris Payne of Billboard categorized it as one of the \\\"tightest pop songs\\\" on California, while NME's Charlotte Gunn pinned it as a \\\"gem\\\" that will \\\"never leave your head.\\\" Some critics, including Evan Lucy at Alternative Press and AllMusic's Neil Z. Yeung, considered the song to be a rewrite of the band's 2001 single \\\"The Rock Show\\\".\\n\\nMusic video\\nThe song's music video, directed by Nicholas Lam, was first released on October 20, 2016 through Spotify. The clip is designed as a throwback to the band's 1999 video for \\\"What's My Age Again?\\\". It features Vine stars Lele Pons, Hannah Stocking, and Vale Genta recreating the band's streaking around the streets of Los Angeles. In the performance scene in front of a white background, Lele, Hannah, and Vale mimic playing instruments as Mark, Tom, and Travis respectively. Comedian Adam Devine, a Blink-182 fan, makes a cameo appearance as a nurse, a role played by porn star Janine Lindemulder in the original video.\\n <a href=\\\"http://www.last.fm/music/blink-182/_/She%27s+Out+Of+Her+Mind\\\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
